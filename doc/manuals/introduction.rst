============

The DIVA program is a research program funded by IARPA.  For more details on DIVA, visit
`here <https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/diva>`_.

The DIVA framework is a open software framework for deploying advanced analytics
in a multi-camera environment.  It is the first framework to provide an open
standard for reasoning across multiple video streams, and in a geographically
or topologically diverse environment.

Visit the `repository <https://github.com/Kitware/diva>`_ on how to get and build the DIVA framework code base.
