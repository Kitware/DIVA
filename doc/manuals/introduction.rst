Introduction
============

The DIVA program intends to develop robust automated activity detection for a multi-camera streaming video environment. 
As an essential aspect of DIVA, activities will be enriched by person and object detection, 
as well as recognition at multiple levels of granularity.
DIVA provides a common framework and software prototype for activity detection, 
person/object detection and recognition across a multi-camera network. 
This framework supports the development of tools for forensic analysis, 
as well as real-time alerting for userdefined threat scenarios.
